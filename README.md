# coffee-deliver-mobile-app

**Kotlin-based mobile app prototype** — a coffee delivery app built with modern Android architecture and best practices. This README expands the initial one-line description into purpose, features, architecture, setup steps, UI flows, data model suggestions, API contract ideas, and a roadmap for turning the prototype into a production-ready app.

---

## Project Overview

This project is a mobile prototype for ordering and delivering coffee. It implements core flows a typical user expects: browsing a menu, customizing drinks, placing an order, tracking order status, managing addresses and payment methods, and receiving delivery updates. The prototype uses Kotlin, Android Jetpack libraries, and common community tools to keep the codebase modern, testable and maintainable.

### Goals

* Provide a clean, intuitive user journey from discovery to delivery.
* Demonstrate a modular and testable codebase using MVVM and Jetpack components.
* Support offline-friendly behavior (caching menu and last orders).
* Be easy to iterate on UI and business logic for future features.

---

## Key Features (Prototype)

* Browse coffee menu with categories (Espresso, Latte, Cold Brew, Tea, Pastry)
* Product detail screen with customization (size, milk, syrup, extras)
* Add to cart, update quantities, and persistent cart using Room
* Checkout flow with address selection, tip, and payment method
* Order confirmation and a simple order tracking screen (simulated statuses)
* User profile: view and edit name, phone, saved addresses
* Basic push-notification simulation (local notifications for status updates)
* Offline caching for menu and recent orders

---

## Suggested Tech Stack

* Language: Kotlin
* UI: Jetpack Compose (recommended for new prototypes) or XML + ViewBinding
* Architecture: MVVM (ViewModel + LiveData / StateFlow)
* Networking: Retrofit + OkHttp
* JSON: Kotlinx.serialization or Moshi
* Local storage: Room (for cart, addresses, cached menu)
* Dependency Injection: Hilt
* Image loading: Coil
* Coroutines + Flow for async
* Navigation: Jetpack Navigation (Compose Navigation if using Compose)
* Testing: JUnit, Mockito / MockK, Espresso (UI)

## Example Screen Flow

1. **Splash** -> checks cached auth/token & loads menu cache
2. **Home / Menu** -> categories + featured
3. **Product Detail** -> choose size, milk, extras -> Add to Cart
4. **Cart** -> edit quantities, choose pickup/delivery
5. **Checkout** -> address, tip, payment method, confirm
6. **Order Tracking** -> status timeline (Received → Preparing → En Route → Delivered)
7. **Profile** -> manage addresses, payment methods, order history

---

## Data Models (examples)

```kotlin
data class Product(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val description: String,
    val price: Double,
    val imageUrl: String,
    val category: String
)

data class CartItem(
    val productId: String,
    val name: String,
    val quantity: Int,
    val price: Double,
    val customizations: Map<String, String>
)

enum class OrderStatus { RECEIVED, PREPARING, EN_ROUTE, DELIVERED, CANCELLED }
```

---

## Example API Contract (mock)

* `GET /api/menu` — returns categories and products
* `GET /api/products/{id}` — product details
* `POST /api/orders` — place an order (body: cart, address, payment)
* `GET /api/orders/{orderId}` — order status & ETA
* `POST /api/users/login` — authenticate user
* `GET /api/users/{id}/addresses` — saved addresses

When prototyping, you can use a mocked backend (JSON files or tools like Mockoon / Postman mock servers) or Firebase Cloud Functions for a quick backend.

---

## Persistence

* Use Room to store:

  * Cart contents (persist between app restarts)
  * Saved addresses and user profile
  * Cached menu (for offline browsing)

* Keep network and local models decoupled — map DTOs to domain models.

---

## UI / UX Guidelines

* Color palette: warm coffee tones — rich brown (#4B2E2E), cream (#F5EDE6), accent yellow for CTA (#FFC857)
* Typography: clear hierarchy — large readable product names, smaller descriptions
* Accessibility: content descriptions for images, high-contrast buttons, font scaling support
* Animations: subtle micro-interactions (add-to-cart fly animation, progress for order updates)

---

## Sample Implementation Notes

* **Adding to cart**: create a `CartRepository` backed by Room. Expose cart as a `StateFlow<List<CartItem>>` from the repository.
* **Checkout**: validate address and payment, call `OrdersApi.placeOrder()`, and store the order locally with an initial status of `RECEIVED`.
* **Order updates**: for prototype, simulate updates with a timer that advances status. For production, use sockets or push notifications.

---

## Development Setup

1. Install Android Studio (latest stable)
2. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd coffee-deliver-mobile-app
```

3. Open the project in Android Studio and let Gradle sync
4. Create `local.properties` entries for any API keys (if using third-party services)
5. Run the app on an emulator or device

---

## Dependencies (example)

* `androidx.core:core-ktx`
* `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx`
* `androidx.room:room-runtime` + `room-ktx`
* `com.google.dagger:hilt-android`
* `com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit`
* `io.coil-kt:coil`
* Jetpack Compose dependencies (if using Compose)

---

## Testing

* UnitTest business logic (use cases, repositories with fake data)
* Integration tests for Room DAOs
* Instrumentation/UI tests (Espresso or Compose testing) for key flows (add to cart, checkout)

---

## Roadmap / Next Steps

* Integrate a simple payment provider (Stripe / Razorpay / PayPal sandbox)
* Add real-time order tracking (WebSockets / Firebase Realtime DB)
* Add loyalty program (points, coupons)
* Add admin panel to manage menu and view orders
* Add onboarding & analytics
